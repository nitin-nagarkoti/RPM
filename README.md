# RPM
This repository contains implementations of various rock physics models (KT, SCA, DEM and SCA-DEM) for predicting elastic moduli, performing pore aspect ratio inversion, and conducting sensitivity analyses. The models included are:
Min_est.ipynb contain code for estimating matrix moduli and data filtering using Hashin-Shrikmen bounds.
Alp.ipynb contain code to find a single pore aspect ratio for modeling elastic moduli for well.
RPM_com.ipynb contain code of Rock Physcis Models comparison.
Inv_alp.ipynb contain code for pore aspect ratio inversion of well.
RPM_sen.ipynb contain code for sensitivity analysis of different models wrt pore aspect ratio.
Wallula.xlsx contain well log responses for the Wallula well, used as input data for the provided scripts.

This code is developed by Nitin Nagarkoti, rersearch scholar in Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
